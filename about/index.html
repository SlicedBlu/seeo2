        <p>Hello! We are a group of environmentally wary students that wanted to help bring to light the damage we are causing to the environment of our planet. Carbon dioxide, or CO2, entering the atmosphere has harmful effects to the environment such as raising the global temperature, which causes the polar glaciers to melt and thus raise the sea level. If this isn’t mitigated, our homes could end up submerged underwater. This is no longer a problem that we can “ignore for the younger generation to handle” - we ARE the younger generation. Thankfully, trees and other plants have the ability to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere due to their natural processes. You can do your part by donating to get trees planted, or by using alternative ways of travel such as carpooling, using public transportation, or using personal transport such as walking or bicycles. Remember, the future of tomorrow is in <i> our </i> hands!</p>
